# Joshua Nguyen's Photo Grid

This is the take home assignment submission for the task to design a photo grid. It fetches random images from Unsplash and displays the images in a responsive grid.
* Clicking on an image allows the user to view the image in a larger full screen format. 
* In this full screen format, the user can click next or prev to scroll through the images.
* Once the fullscreen mode is closed, the same last viewed image will be scrolled into view oin the grid. 
* To load more images, simply scroll to the bottom and wait a brief moment for more images to load.
* The design is responsive and works in normal desktop browser as well as mobile screen dimensions.
